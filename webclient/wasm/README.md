### Simple JS Bindings for libopus

Very simplified version of https://github.com/abalabahaha/opusscript used to build opus and the other classes

Make sure the submodules are initialized

Simply set up the emsdk environment and run `make`

Put the files in build into the asset folder of the webclient in ../src/assets
