### Simple JS Bindings for libopus

Very simplified version of https://github.com/abalabahaha/opusscript used to build opus and the other classes

Make sure the submodules are initialized

Simply set up the emsdk environment and run `make`. Do yourself a favor and do this on linux or maybe OS X since I haven't tested this on windows.
